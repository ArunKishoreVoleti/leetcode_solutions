        """
        Determines whether the given list of integers `nums` contains
        two consecutive increasing subarrays of at least length `k`.

        The function checks for overlapping increasing sequences
        in the array â€” i.e., sequences where each next number is 
        greater than the previous one. It maintains the lengths of 
        the current and previous increasing subarrays to find the
        maximum overlap possible.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): The input list of integers.
            k (int): The required minimum length of overlapping increasing subarrays.

        Returns:
            bool: True if such two consecutive increasing subarrays exist, False otherwise.
